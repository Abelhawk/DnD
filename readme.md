# Dungeons & Dragons Tools

These apps can be used to quickly create content for Dungeon Masters or players.

## Getting Started

Nothing needs to be downloaded. Simply open and use the tools as needed.

## Features

### Town & Place Generator
This generator uses a cutting-edge algorithm to figure out the coolest place names possible.
* Can generate place names for grasslands, hills, forests, deserts, arctic areas, coasts, swamps, and cities
* Can generate in the following flavors: peaceful, dangerous, scary, or natural
* Can add a specific landmark to the end of the phrase for inspiration on dungeons and locales.
* Can make the name more "descriptive," like a recently named location based on its characteristics.
* Can generate a "mystical"-sounding name of a location. (Honestly, kind of janky, but maybe someone will find it useful)
* Can make a "possessive" landmark, named after a specific person, or a type of person (beggar, dead man, lover, etc.)
* Utilizes a bank of over 770 words to generate the names (with more as I think of them. Suggestions welcome!)

### Character Creator
This is primarily used to come up with NPC names on the spot, but it can also be used to generate backstories and inspiration for player characters.
* Generates a name for a new D&D character depending on the gender and race chosen, based on Xanathar's Guide to Everything's randomization
* Half-breeds like half-elves, half-orcs and tieflings have randomly generated backgrounds and heritages
* Uses a complex algorithm to generate a background, siblings, origin story, and more.

### Treasure Generator
This is used to easily create loot for players to find, whether that be valuable treasure, interesting garbage, or more unique individual items.
* Uses the treasure tables in the *DMG* to generate money, gems, art objects, and magic items in a hoard or individually.
* Can generate random "pickings," or less valuable but more interesting items for characters to find, such as trade goods, tools, trinkets, spell components, or straight-up garbage.
* Can create unique magic items using the Special Features section of the *DMG.*
* Can generate a collection of items based on a Persuasion check, along with the proposed prices.

### Combat Calculator
This calculator can make mob attacks easy to calculate when running high numbers of monsters in an encounter.
* Can calculate the number of creatures that hit a target based on their attack bonus and the target's AC.
* Can calculate the number of creatures that succeed on a saving throw based on their bonus and the target's DC.
* Checks can be made with Advantage or Disadvantage

### Settlement Populator
This tool can quickly generate the basic demographic and ecological information needed for a homebrew settlement. It uses information from the *DMG* as well as researched information from medieval history.
* Identifies the type of settlement based on its population.
* Gives information on the settlement's government, defense, religion, and economics.
* Provides example locations and a proposed number of districts the settlement might have.

### Misfortune Manager
This tool can quickly generate random occurrences (most of them unfortunate) for characters when they use a cursed item, touch a trap, or mess with a sibriex.
* Can generate Wild Magic surges, spell and potion mishaps, lingering injuries, madness, curses, trap damage, and flesh warping.
* Lingering injuries are customizable by damage type
* Or you can just generate a completely random misfortune!

## Known Bugs
* Character Creator doesn't really work at all beyond generating a name, and even then the interface is clunky
