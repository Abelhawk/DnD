# Dungeons & Dragons Generators

These two generators can be used to quickly create content for Dungeon Masters or players. The generators use a cutting-edge algorithm to figure out the coolest place names possible.

## Getting Started

Nothing needs to be downloaded. Simply open either web page and click GENERATE! or CREATE MY CHARACTER! and you're good to go.

## Features

### Town & Place Generator
* Can generate place names for grasslands, hills, forests, deserts, arctic areas, coasts, swamps, and cities
* Can generate in the following flavors: peaceful, dangerous, scary, or natural
* Can add a specific landmark to the end of the phrase for inspiration on dungeons and locales
* Has a bank of over 770 words that can be put together (with more as I think of them. Suggestions welcome!)

### Character Creator
* Generates a name for a new D&D character depending on the gender and race chosen, based on Xanathar's Guide to Everything's randomization
* Half-breeds like half-elves, half-orcs and tieflings have randomly generated backgrounds and heritages
* Uses a complex algorithm to generate a background, siblings, origin story, and more.

##Known Bugs
* Character Creator doesn't really work at all beyond generating a name, and even then the interface is clunky
* Probably need to redo the entire project in Angular, make it mobile-friendly, etc.
