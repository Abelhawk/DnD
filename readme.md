# Dungeons & Dragons Tools

These apps can be used to quickly create content for Dungeon Masters or players.

## Getting Started

Nothing needs to be downloaded. Simply open the site and use the tools as needed.

## Features

### Town & Place Generator

This generator uses a cutting-edge algorithm to figure out the coolest place names possible.

* Can generate place names for grasslands, hills, forests, deserts, arctic areas, coasts, swamps,
  and cities
* Can generate in the following flavors: peaceful, dangerous, scary, or natural
* Can add a specific landmark to the end of the phrase for inspiration on dungeons and locales.
* Can make the name more "descriptive," like a recently named location based on its characteristics.
* Can generate a "mystical"-sounding name of a location. (Honestly, kind of janky, but maybe someone
  will find it useful)
* Can make a "possessive" landmark, named after a specific person, or a type of person (beggar, dead
  man, lover, etc.)
* Utilizes a bank of over 770 words to generate the names (with more as I think of them. Suggestions
  welcome!)

Here is a description of the place options you can choose to generate:

* **Location.** A simple combination of two words. Good for countries or town names.
* **Landmark.** A combination of two words and a landmark based on the biome. Very *World of
  Warcraft*-sounding.
* **Descriptive.** A much more modern-sounding combination based on an area's description: Either a
  description of a place ("Old Road"), a numbering of a landmark ("Thousand Springs"), or simple "
  the" in front of a word ("The Heathers").
* **Mystical.** Kinda janky, but maybe it'll give inspiration. It reverses the normal order and
  adds "of" in between the words.
* **Possessive.** Adds a random name or title in front of a landmark to give it a possessive feel.

### Character Creator

This is primarily used to come up with NPC names on the spot, but it can also be used to generate
backstories and inspiration for player characters.

* Generates a name for a new D&D character depending on the gender and race chosen, based on
  Xanathar's Guide to Everything's randomization
* Half-breeds like half-elves, half-orcs and tieflings have randomly generated backgrounds and
  heritages
* Uses a complex algorithm to generate a background, siblings, origin story, and more.

### Treasure Generator

This is used to easily create loot for players to find, whether that be valuable treasure,
interesting garbage, or more unique individual items.

* Uses the treasure tables in the *DMG* to generate money, gems, art objects, and magic items in a
  hoard or individually.
* Can generate random "pickings," or less valuable but more interesting items for characters to
  find, such as trade goods, tools, trinkets, spell components, or straight-up garbage.
* Can create unique magic items using the Special Features section of the *DMG.*
* Can generate a collection of items based on a Persuasion check, along with the proposed prices.

### Combat Calculator

This calculator can make mob attacks easy to calculate when running high numbers of monsters in an
encounter.

* Can calculate the number of creatures that hit a target based on their attack bonus and the
  target's AC.
* Can calculate the number of creatures that succeed on a saving throw based on their bonus and the
  target's DC.
* Checks can be made with Advantage or Disadvantage

### Settlement Populator

This tool can quickly generate the basic demographic and ecological information needed for a
homebrew settlement. It uses information from the *DMG* as well as researched information from
medieval history.

* Identifies the type of settlement based on its population.
* Gives information on the settlement's government, defense, religion, and economics.
* Provides example locations and a proposed number of districts the settlement might have.

### Misfortune Manager

This tool can quickly generate random occurrences (most of them unfortunate) for characters when
they use a cursed item, touch a trap, or mess with a sibriex.

* Can generate Wild Magic surges, spell and potion mishaps, lingering injuries, madness, curses,
  trap damage, and flesh warping.
* Lingering injuries are customizable by damage type
* Or you can just generate a completely random misfortune!

## Planned Features

* Replace the Character Creator with an "NPC Creator" that generates quirks and appearance in addition to name.
* Improve Loot Generator to group duplicates together. You know, like "2 x potion of longevity"
* Make an Encounter Generator, complete with a random theater-of-the-mind map, creatures, maybe even a description to introduce it and everything. Gonna take a whole lotta work though.
* Revamp the magic item distribution. The "Magic Item Tables" in the DMG are actually really stupid.
* Jazz up the realism of the settlement populator's larger cities just a little bit. Perhaps generating a few factions within the city that might be there.
